# bayesian-inverse-heat-transfer-paper
This repository provides all the necessary code and data to reproduce the results presented in our paper on Bayesian inverse heat transfer using data assimilation. It includes Gaussian and Multiquadric RBF-based reconstructions, visualization scripts, and reproducible containerized environments using **Docker** or **Singularity**.
